# MG-log amateur radio log for Android
This is an amateur radio log app written in Python and Kivy to be used on Android. The Interface is simple and built with portable operation in mind. Data storage is handled by SQLite. Logs can be exported to ADIF. The app is published in [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lb9mg), but runs only on old Android versions (below 5)

# How to run
On Linux : [install Kivy](https://kivy.org/) and simply execute `./main.py`. On Android : build the APK with [python-for-android](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android) or [buildozer](https://github.com/kivy/buildozer). So far I have only managed to run these APKs on old Android version (below 5).
